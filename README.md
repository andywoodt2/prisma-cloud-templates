# prisma-cloud-templates

#### This is a temporary repo.  Eventually this will live elsewhere.

This repo will contain a selection of BASH scripts that leverage the Prisma Cloud API to perform specific functions.

While Palo Alto's Prisma Cloud API documentation is quite extensive, there are a number of gotchas I've encountered along the way, which I try to cover in the comments of my scripts.

I write in BASH, that's what I do - so for you Python lovers, I can offer no assistance.
